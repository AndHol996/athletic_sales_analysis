The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to improve understanding of working with pivot tables and groupby functions.

## Conditions
The only specification of for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment, kernel, and imported pandas.

## Code Sourcing and Influences
The code was influenced by the OSU AI Bootcamp lessons. Code took influence from "Convert the column type from string to datetime format in Pandas dataframe" by shubham__ranjan on geeksforgeeks.org for Code Cell 10, Line 4 of athletic_sales_analysis.jpynb and from "How to check if any value is NaN in a pandas DataFrame" by AJ Welch from atlassian.com for Code Cell 8, Lines 3 of athletic_sales_analysis.jpynb.
